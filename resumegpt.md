# ResumeGPT Status – Sprint Complete

## ✅ Summary
- All tests passed (14/14)
- Pre-commit checks passed (black, isort, mypy)
- Pylint warnings are minor and tracked
- GitHub branch `main` is clean and up-to-date

## 🔧 Outstanding Issues
- [ ] Address `too-many-arguments` warning in `Unit` constructor if desired

## 🏁 Next Sprint Ideas
- Add simple battle logic or turn UI
- Create CLI or basic Pygame visualization
- Refactor `Unit` if modularization is a priority

## 📌 Restart Prompt
"Resume the `starter-town-tactics` project from clean state, tests passing. Focus on [feature/goal], and begin from the current design and architecture."

## ✅ Highlights This Week

### 🎮 Mouse UI Completed
- Unit selection via mouse click
- Tile highlight and outline on hover
- Click-to-move support for selected units
- Move preview tile in green
- Camera panning with arrow keys
- Debug overlay: turn count, camera position, hover and unit info

### 🔍 Testing & Quality
- All 15 tests passing (`pytest` ✅)
- Pre-commit hooks:
  - `black` ✅
  - `isort` ✅
  - `mypy` ✅
  - `pylint` warnings only (non-blocking style suggestions)

### 📦 Code Health
- `main.py` is functional but growing large (refactor candidate for Week 3)
- Sprite loading is modular via `SpriteManager`
- Grid and unit logic validated with tests

### 📤 GitHub
- All changes pushed to `main` branch
- Commit: _"Finalize mouse UI: selection, move preview, debug overlay"_

## 📌 Plan Going Forward

### 🧭 Week 3 Preview: Input & Navigation
1. **Keyboard Navigation (Fire Emblem style)**
   - WASD/Arrow key controlled cursor
   - Unit selection & move preview

2. **Game Loop + State Machine**
   - Distinguish player phase vs enemy phase
   - Click confirmation to finalize move

3. **Refactor**
   - Split `main.py` into input handling, rendering, and loop modules

4. **Test Coverage**
   - Add tests for input state, selection logic, and move preview

5. **README**
   - Include run instructions, screenshots, feature checklist
