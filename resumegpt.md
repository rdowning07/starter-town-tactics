### **4v4 Tactical Combat System Achievements**
- **Multi-Unit Combat**: Complete 4v4 tactical combat with 8 units total (4 player team vs 4 enemy bandits)
- **Smart AI System**: Intelligent targeting where mage/ranger target closest bandit, bandits pursue fighter
- **Collision Detection**: No units can occupy the same tile, preventing overlap
- **Individual Unit Tracking**: Each bandit has separate HP/AP/position tracking
- **Professional Combat Flow**: Damage, healing, projectiles, visual effects, AP management
- **Visual Variety**: Different bandit poses using same sprite assets for cost-effective scaling
- **Player Team**: Fighter (player control), Mage (AI), Healer (AI), Ranger (AI)
- **Enemy Team**: 4 Bandits (AI) with independent behavior and targeting

### **4v4 Combat Features Delivered**
- ✅ **8 Units Total**: 4 player team vs 4 enemy bandits in tactical combat
- ✅ **Smart Targeting**: AI units intelligently select targets based on distance and threat
- ✅ **Collision System**: Prevents tile sharing between units with proper collision detection
- ✅ **Individual Tracking**: Each unit has separate HP/AP/position with independent behavior
- ✅ **Visual Effects**: Fireball and arrow projectiles with proper hit detection and animations
- ✅ **Healing System**: Healer targets lowest HP ally with visible healing effects
- ✅ **AP Management**: All units consume and regenerate AP appropriately with timing
- ✅ **Professional Gameplay**: Complete tactical combat experience with strategic depth

### **Technical Implementation**
- **Scalable Architecture**: Successfully scaled from 1v1 to 4v4 using same sprite assets
- **AI Behavior**: Each bandit acts independently with smart targeting and movement
- **Collision Detection**: Helper functions prevent units from occupying same tiles
- **Individual Stats**: Arrays track HP/AP for each bandit with proper indexing
- **Visual Rendering**: All 4 bandits render with different poses for visual variety
- **Combat Balance**: Proper damage values, ranges, and AP costs for tactical gameplay

**Status: 4v4 tactical combat system fully functional and ready for architecture improvements. Complete tactical gameplay experience with professional combat mechanics, smart AI, and visual effects. Ready for Factory spawn, AI scheduler, and victory service enhancements.**
