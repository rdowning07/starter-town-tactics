## ✅ Week 2 Achievements – Mouse UI + Debug Overlay

### 🔧 Core Gameplay Features
- ✅ Unit selection via mouse click
- ✅ Tile hover highlight
- ✅ Click-to-move with movement preview (green tile)
- ✅ Camera panning using arrow keys
- ✅ Debug overlay: turn number, unit info, tile hover location

### 🧪 Testing & Quality
- Full test suite passed: `pytest` ✅ (15/15)
- All pre-commit hooks succeeded:
  - `black`, `isort`, `mypy` ✅
  - `pylint` rating 9.67/10 — warnings tracked but non-blocking

### 📦 Architecture & Cleanup
- Added modular `SpriteManager` for tile/unit/ui loading
- Removed legacy `game/main.py` → replaced with unified `main.py`
- Simplified tile rendering + moved camera logic to game state
- New `test_sprite_manager.py` for asset validation

### 📤 GitHub
- Pushed to `main`
- Commit message:  
  `"Finalize: sprites, updated game.py, moved main.py, tests and docs"`

## 🚀 Week 3 Kickoff Plan – Keyboard Input & State Flow

### 🎮 Input Expansion
- ⌨️ Add keyboard-based cursor movement (WASD/arrow keys)
- 🖱️ Support dual input mode (mouse + keyboard coexist)
- 🔁 Switch between selected unit and movement preview

### 🎯 State Machine Design
- Introduce game phases:
  - Player Select → Move → Confirm
  - Enemy Turn (stub for now)
- Build input handling module (extract from `main.py`)

### 🧹 Refactor Goals
- Split large `main.py` into:
  - `input_handler.py`
  - `renderer.py`
  - `game_loop.py`
- Evaluate `Unit` constructor for simplification (`pylint` warning)

### 🧪 Tests To Add
- Cursor movement logic
- Unit selection state machine
- Preview tile edge case coverage

## 🧰 Outstanding Tasks

- [ ] Add keyboard-based cursor + action selection
- [ ] Begin state machine for player phase
- [ ] Break out `main.py` into clean modules
- [ ] Address `too-many-arguments` in `Unit` class (optional)
