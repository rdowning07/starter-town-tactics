# resumegpt.md - Sprint Log

## ‚úÖ Status as of End of Sprint

**Tests Passing:** 31 / 39  
**Coverage:** 83%  
**Code Health:** Mid-stage refactor, core logic nearly restored  
**Push State:** Broken build, documented for resume later

---

## üîß Recent Fixes Completed
- ‚úÖ `sim_runner.py`: Turn loop and `.log` implemented
- ‚úÖ `turn_controller.py`: Added `TurnPhase` enum and phased turn logic
- ‚úÖ `grid_output.py`: ASCII output matching tests
- ‚úÖ `grid.py`, `tile.py`, and `game.py`: Mostly passing and structurally sound

---

## ‚ùå Remaining Test Failures (8)
1. **GamepadController key mapping (`UP`)**
2. **InputState selection and movement logic**
3. **KeyboardController input case mismatch**
4. **MCP keypress casing issue**
5. **SimRunner `.log` attribute still reported missing**
6. **TurnController test missing `game` argument**
7. **Unit.move()` allowing terrain-cost violating move**
8. **KeyPress assertions expect different casing**

## üß† Evaluation Suggestions for Next Sprint
- [ ] Decide whether to standardize key input to lowercase or uppercase across all input systems
- [ ] Audit test helpers like `make_input_state_with_unit()` for completeness
- [ ] Review input systems as one whole (Keyboard, Gamepad, MCP) to ensure consistent integration
- [ ] Refactor `Unit.move()` to use terrain cost checks properly
- [ ] Set goal to return to 100% passing tests or decide whether to archive and restart cleaner

## ‚è≠Ô∏è Next Sprint Recommendation
- Fix `TurnController` test first with mock `Game`
- Normalize `InputState.key_states` casing and adjust all controllers/tests
- Complete `Unit.move()` terrain validation
- Push stable state to GitHub with branch/tag: `fix/recovery-integration`
