### **Phase 9: Code Refactoring & Optimization (CURRENT)**
**Current Challenge:** The main demo file `ai_bt_fighter_demo_with_title.py` has grown to 2,421 lines and 101KB, exceeding AI interaction token limits and making the codebase difficult to maintain.

**Systematic Analysis Completed:**
- **File Size:** 2,421 lines, 101KB (exceeds 25,000 token limit)
- **Structure:** 57 methods, 295 comment lines, 5 large AI methods (~500 lines)
- **Unused Code:** ParticleSystem, GradientSweep, ControlCard imports unused
- **Refactoring Opportunities:** AI methods, UI panels, effect creation, asset loading

**Refactoring Strategy:**
- **Phase 1:** Remove unused imports and debug code (~200 lines reduction)
- **Phase 2:** Extract modules (AI, UI, Effects, Asset Loading) (~900 lines reduction)
- **Phase 3:** Final cleanup and optimization

**Expected Results:** 50% file size reduction (2,421 → ~1,200 lines) for better maintainability and AI interaction capability.

**Current Punch List:**
1. Fix file size issue - Main problem requiring immediate attention
2. Fix SlowMo import error in victory system
3. Make ranger move and fire arrows in combat
4. Halve the number of screen flashes
5. Show heal effect on white mage and target
6. Add fade to black on title screen and fade in to combat
