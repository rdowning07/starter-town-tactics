## 🏗️ Command-Event Architecture

The game now uses a modern command-event architecture for better testability and extensibility:

### Core Components
- **Commands**: Immutable game actions (`Move`, `Attack`, `EndTurn`)
- **Events**: Decoupled communication via `EventBus`
- **Game Loop**: Orchestrates command-event flow with deterministic RNG
- **Controllers**: Protocol-based AI and player input abstraction

### CLI Tools
```bash
# Run command-event architecture demo
make play-demo

# Performance testing (target: 3000+ ticks/sec)
make soak

# Future: Game replay functionality
make replay
```

### Performance
- **Current**: 800,000+ ticks/sec (excellent performance)
- **Target**: 3,000+ ticks/sec for CI gates
- **Deterministic**: Seeded RNG for reproducible gameplay

## 🗺 Scenario System

Scenarios are defined in YAML and include camera actions, AI behaviors, and scripted events:

```yaml
name: "Cinematic Battle"
description: "A dramatic battle with camera work"
map_id: "arena"
max_turns: 12

units:
  - name: "hero"
    team: player
    sprite: "knight"
    x: 5
    y: 5
    hp: 15
    ap: 6
    animation: "idle"
  - name: "enemy"
    team: enemy
    sprite: "rogue"
    x: 8
    y: 8
    hp: 12
    ap: 5
    animation: "idle"
    ai: "aggressive"

camera:
  - action: "pan"
    targets: 
      - [160, 160]  # Starting position
      - [320, 320]  # Intermediate position
      - [480, 480]  # Final position
    speed: 10
    delay: 0.5

ai:
  - unit: "enemy"
    action: "attack"
    target: "hero"
  - unit: "enemy"
    action: "move"
    target: [6, 6]

actions:
  - unit: "hero"
    action: "prepare_for_battle"
```

Terrain maps:

```
G G G G
R G F G
W G G G
```

## 🎥 Camera System

The integrated camera controller provides:

- **Cinematic Panning**: Smooth movement between multiple targets
- **Smooth Movement**: Gradual camera transitions
- **Target Following**: Automatic unit tracking
- **YAML Integration**: Camera actions defined in scenario files
- **Configurable Speed**: Adjustable movement rates
- **Delay Support**: Timing control between camera movements
