# Gameflow Enhancement Summary

## Overview

The game has been enhanced with three new management systems that work together to create a more dynamic and engaging gameplay experience:

1. **ObjectivesManager** - Dynamic objective tracking and updates
2. **EventManager** - Turn-based event triggering
3. **Enhanced AIController** - Improved AI behavior with personality types

## New Components

### 1. ObjectivesManager (`game/objectives_manager.py`)

**Purpose**: Manages dynamic game objectives that change based on game state.

**Key Features**:
- **Dynamic Objective Updates**: Objectives change based on victory/defeat conditions
- **Objective History**: Tracks all objective changes for replay/debugging
- **Integration with GameState**: Uses existing `has_won()` and `has_lost()` methods

**Example Usage**:
```python
# Objectives automatically update based on game state
objectives_manager.update_objectives()

# Get current objective
current = game_state.get_current_objective()
print(f"Current objective: {current}")
```

**Objective States**:
- **Victory**: "Victory! The enemies have been defeated."
- **Defeat**: "Defeat. You lost the battle."
- **Survive**: "Survive until reinforcements arrive!" (when all enemies defeated but game continues)
- **Default**: "Defeat all enemies!"

### 2. EventManager (`game/event_manager.py`)

**Purpose**: Manages turn-based events that trigger at specific turn counts.

**Key Features**:
- **Turn-Based Triggers**: Events trigger at specific turn numbers
- **One-Time Events**: Each event only triggers once
- **Event History**: Complete logging of all triggered events
- **FX Integration**: Events can trigger visual effects

**Built-in Events**:
- **Turn 5**: Reinforcements arrive (adds 2 new player units)
- **Turn 10**: Storm weather effect (reduces visibility)
- **Turn 15**: Boss phase (enemy units become more aggressive)

**Example Usage**:
```python
# Advance turn and trigger events
game_state.advance_turn()

# Check if specific event has triggered
if game_state.has_event_triggered("reinforcements"):
    print("Reinforcements have arrived!")

# Get all triggered events
events = game_state.get_triggered_events()
```

### 3. Enhanced AIController (`game/ai_controller.py`)

**Purpose**: Provides more sophisticated AI behavior based on unit personality types.

**Key Features**:
- **Personality-Based Behavior**: Different AI types (aggressive, defensive, passive)
- **Health-Based Decisions**: AI makes different choices based on unit health
- **Backward Compatibility**: Maintains existing interface while adding new features
- **GameState Integration**: AI can access game state for better decision making

**AI Behavior Types**:

#### **Aggressive AI**
- Attacks player units when health is high
- Heals when health is low (< 50%)
- Always seeks combat

#### **Defensive AI**
- Retreats when health is low (< 50%)
- Heals or defends when health is high
- Prioritizes survival

#### **Passive AI**
- Waits and doesn't take action unless provoked
- Minimal intervention in combat

**Example Usage**:
```python
# AI behavior is automatically applied during AI turns
# The system checks unit AI type and applies appropriate behavior

# Manual AI behavior application
ai_controller.decide_action(unit)
```

## Integration with GameState

### **New GameState Methods**

```python
# Turn and event management
game_state.advance_turn()                    # Advance turn and trigger events
game_state.get_turn_count()                  # Get current turn number
game_state.get_triggered_events()            # Get list of triggered events
game_state.has_event_triggered(event_name)   # Check if event triggered

# Objective management
game_state.get_current_objective()           # Get current objective
```

### **Automatic Integration**

The new managers are automatically integrated into GameState:

```python
class GameState:
    def __init__(self):
        # ... existing components ...

        # New managers for enhanced game flow
        self.objectives_manager = ObjectivesManager(self)
        self.event_manager = EventManager(self)

        # Wire up AI controller with game state
        self.ai_controller.set_game_state(self)
```

## Usage Examples

### **Basic Game Loop Integration**

```python
# In your main game loop
def game_loop():
    while not game_state.is_game_over():
        # Process player input
        process_player_input()

        # Advance turn (triggers events and updates objectives)
        game_state.advance_turn()

        # Display current objective
        print(f"Objective: {game_state.get_current_objective()}")

        # Check for triggered events
        if game_state.has_event_triggered("reinforcements"):
            show_reinforcement_animation()
```

### **Scenario Integration**

```python
# In scenario execution
def execute_scenario():
    # Load scenario
    scenario_manager.load_scenario("battle_scenario.yaml")

    # Game automatically manages objectives and events
    while not game_state.is_game_over():
        game_state.advance_turn()

        # Objectives update automatically
        current_objective = game_state.get_current_objective()

        # Events trigger automatically
        if game_state.has_event_triggered("boss_phase"):
            trigger_boss_phase_effects()
```

### **AI Behavior Integration**

```python
# AI behavior is automatically applied
# Units with AI types will behave according to their personality

# Example unit definition in scenario
units:
  - name: "enemy_1"
    team: "enemy"
    ai: "aggressive"    # Will attack aggressively
  - name: "enemy_2"
    team: "enemy"
    ai: "defensive"     # Will retreat when low health
  - name: "enemy_3"
    team: "enemy"
    ai: "passive"       # Will wait and observe
```

## Testing
