## 🎮 Demo Results

### Successful Demo Execution
The enhanced game loop was successfully demonstrated with:

1. **Basic Game Loop Demo**
   - 4 units (2 player, 2 enemy)
   - 5 turns with reinforcements triggered
   - Proper objective updates
   - Victory condition detection

2. **Events Demo**
   - 2 units (1 player, 1 enemy)
   - 8 turns with multiple reinforcements
   - Event triggering and handling
   - State persistence across turns
