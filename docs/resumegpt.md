# ResumeGPT Status – Sprint Complete

## ✅ Summary

- Pre-commit checks passed (black, isort, mypy)
- Pylint warnings are minor and tracked
- GitHub branch `main` is clean and up-to-date

## 🔧 Outstanding Issues

- Create CLI or basic Pygame visualization
- Refactor `Unit` if modularization is a priority

## 📌 Restart Prompt
"Resume the `starter-town-tactics` project from clean state, tests passing. Focus on [feature/goal], and begin from the current design and architecture."

## Next Steps
1. Refactor `unit.py` (currently exceeding argument limits).
2. Begin UI/UX scaffolding using `pygame`.
3. Add more unit tests around edge cases and movement validation.
4. Define MVP for playable demo.
