# Architecture Overview

## Project: Starter Town Tactics

Starter Town Tactics is a Python-based tactical RPG inspired by Final Fantasy Tactics. It is structured around modular components and test-driven development.

**ðŸŽ‰ Technical Foundation Complete!** The project has achieved 97%+ test coverage and is ready for game development phase.

## Key Architectural Components

### `game/`
- Core gameplay logic, models, and controllers.
- Interfaces follow `# @api` and `# @contract` tags for stability tracking.

| `sprite_manager.py`   | Asset management and sprite handling            | âœ… Complete |

### `game/overlay/`
- Rendering overlays such as threat zones, movement range, etc.
- âœ… Complete with grid overlays and visual feedback

### `game/ui/`
- Debug and visual overlays (non-core).
- âœ… Complete with debug information display

### `tests/`
- Pytest test suite for all gameplay logic, targeting 100% coverage.
- âœ… **97%+ coverage achieved** across 61 tests

## Development Tools

- **Cursor**: AI-based code editor with `.cursor/config.json` for file indexing and architectural context.
- **ChatGPT**: Acts as Principal Engineer and Test Architect.
- **Claude**: Used for summarization and exploratory code analysis.
- **VS Code**: Main local IDE.
- **Pre-commit Hooks**: Enforce linting, typing, and formatting before pushes.
