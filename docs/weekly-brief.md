# Weekly Brief - Starter Town Tactics

## Performance Metrics

### Soak Test Results
- **TPS (Ticks Per Second)**: 612,059.1
- **Performance Grade**: Excellent
- **Test Duration**: 10,000 ticks in 0.016 seconds
- **Performance Gate**: ✅ PASSED (≥ 3000 tps required)

### Performance Notes
- System demonstrates excellent performance for real-time gameplay
- Command-event architecture shows minimal overhead
- No performance hotspots identified in current implementation
- Ready for high-frequency game loop requirements

## Determinism

### Replay Consistency
- ✅ **Deterministic Game State**: Same seed + commands → identical end-state hash
- ✅ **Event Ordering**: Events processed in consistent tick order
- ✅ **RNG Integration**: Deterministic random number generation
- ✅ **State Hashing**: SHA256 hash of game state for verification

### Test Coverage
- Comprehensive determinism tests implemented
- Fast execution (< 1 second for full test suite)
- Edge cases covered (empty commands, out-of-bounds, etc.)

## Feature Delta

### Rules Engine
- ✅ **Combat System**: Height & facing bonuses affect damage calculation
- ✅ **Status Effects**: Poison reduces HP, Slow effects implemented
- ✅ **Unit Death**: Death events emit UNIT_KILLED events
- ✅ **Damage Calculation**: Proper HP floors and damage clamping

### Pathfinding (A*)
- ✅ **Obstacle Avoidance**: Units can path around blocked tiles
- ✅ **Unreachable Handling**: Returns None for unreachable targets
- ✅ **Cost Optimization**: Respects terrain costs and movement limits
- ✅ **Performance**: Fast pathfinding for large maps

### Objectives System
- ✅ **All Four Types**: EliminateBoss, SurviveNTurns, HoldZones, Escort
- ✅ **Compound Objectives**: Multi-objective support with AND logic
- ✅ **Event Integration**: Objectives update from game events
- ✅ **Test Coverage**: Comprehensive test suite for all objective types

### Demo System
- ✅ **Visual Demo**: 15-second pygame-based demo with 24×24 grid
- ✅ **Deterministic Battle**: Consistent replay with ~10 units
- ✅ **Performance**: Smooth 60fps rendering
- ✅ **User Controls**: Pause, reset, and quit functionality

### Pygame Adapter
- ✅ **Renderer**: Pull-only renderer for game snapshots
- ✅ **Input Controller**: Event translation for human turns
- ✅ **Integration**: Seamless integration with core game loop

## Technical Achievements

### Code Quality
- ✅ **Type Safety**: Comprehensive mypy type checking
- ✅ **Test Coverage**: 48/48 fast tests passing
- ✅ **Documentation**: Updated README and technical docs
- ✅ **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions with performance gates

### Architecture
- ✅ **Command-Event Pattern**: Decoupled game logic
- ✅ **Deterministic Design**: Replay-consistent game state
- ✅ **Performance Optimized**: High-frequency capable
- ✅ **Extensible**: Easy to add new objectives and rules

## Next Steps

### Immediate Priorities
1. **Demo Enhancement**: Add more complex battle scenarios
2. **UI Polish**: Improve visual feedback and controls
3. **Documentation**: Complete API documentation

### Future Features
1. **AI Improvements**: More sophisticated AI behaviors
2. **Multiplayer**: Network synchronization
3. **Modding Support**: Plugin architecture for custom rules

## Performance Hotspots

No significant performance bottlenecks identified. The system is performing well above requirements with room for additional features.
