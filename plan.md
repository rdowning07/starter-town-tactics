## ✅ PHASE 7: RULES ENGINE & OBJECTIVES (COMPLETED)

### 🎯 Goals ACHIEVED
- ✅ Implement rules engine (height/facing/Poison/Slow)
- ✅ Add A* pathfinding for movement
- ✅ Implement Objectives (EliminateBoss, SurviveNTurns, HoldZones, Escort, Compound)
- ✅ Create thin Pygame adapter for deterministic demo
- ✅ Set up CI gates with performance requirements (612,059 TPS achieved)

### 📋 PR Requirements COMPLETED
1. **✅ Rules Engine Implementation**
   - ✅ Height-based combat modifiers (`core/rules/combat.py`)
   - ✅ Facing direction mechanics with directional bonuses
   - ✅ Status effects (Poison, Slow) (`core/rules/status.py`)
   - ✅ A* pathfinding algorithm (`core/rules/move.py`)

2. **✅ Objectives System**
