### **🎯 CURSOR'S STRATEGIC ASSESSMENT & RECOMMENDATIONS**

**Cursor (AI Tech Lead) Analysis**: As an experienced tech lead who has designed FFT/Fire Emblem-style games, the original plan to jump straight to "Battle System Implementation" is premature. In tactical RPGs, the core gameplay loop is: **Movement → Positioning → Combat → Turn Management**.

**Key Insight**: Positioning is 80% of the strategy in FFT/Fire Emblem games. Players spend most time thinking about where to move to avoid threats and how to position for optimal attacks. Combat is just the resolution of good positioning.

**Strategic Concerns**:
- Missing critical **positioning and tactical depth** before combat
- Need **attack range visualization**, **threat zones**, **movement range preview**
- Turn system needs **action points**, **turn order**, **end turn validation**
- Without strong tactical positioning mechanics, combat feels shallow

## 🚧 Phase 2: Core Gameplay Features (Current)
- [ ] Battle system: attack, damage, death effects
- [ ] Team-based win conditions
- [x] **Map data loading from YAML** - Complete with validation
- [ ] Fog of war and vision radius
- [x] **Basic animation/visual feedback hooks** - Asset system ready

### **🎮 REVISED PLAN: Tactical-First Approach**

#### **Phase 2a: Enhanced Movement & Positioning (90% Complete)**
- [x] Attack range visualization overlays
- [x] Threat zone calculations and display
- [x] Movement range preview with pathfinding
- [x] **Terrain loading and validation** - Map loader with error handling
- [ ] Terrain effects on positioning (cover, elevation)

#### **Phase 2b: Turn System Enhancement (95% Complete)**
- [x] Action point system (move + attack, or multiple moves)
- [x] Turn order display and initiative
- [x] End turn validation and confirmation
- [x] Turn state management (selecting, moving, attacking, ending)
- [x] **Fake death mechanics** - Unit revival system implemented

#### **Phase 2c: Tactical UI Improvements (80% Complete)**
- [x] Clear visual feedback for valid/invalid actions
- [x] **Asset management system** - Complete sprite loading infrastructure
- [x] Turn indicator and action point display
- [ ] Hover effects showing attack ranges and movement
- [ ] Undo/redo functionality for moves

#### **Phase 2d: Asset & Visual System (85% Complete)**
- [x] **Complete asset directory structure** - Organized by type and team
- [x] **Asset loading infrastructure** - SpriteManager with terrain/unit/UI support
- [x] **Asset acquisition guide** - Safe sources and licensing documentation
- [x] **Asset validation tools** - Setup scripts and safety checklists
- [ ] **Pygame integration** - Visual rendering with new asset system

## 🧪 Testing + Quality

- [x] mypy compliant (100%)
- [x] **Pylint compliant (10.00/10)** - All errors resolved
- [x] **Enhanced test coverage** - Edge cases, integration, performance tests
- [x] **Asset system tests** - Map loader, scenario loader validation
- [ ] Add integration tests for end-to-end scenario

## 🛠️ Tooling + Dev Experience
- [x] Updated Makefile with demo/play targets
- [x] Log formatting and emoji feedback
- [x] **Asset management tools** - Setup scripts and validation
- [x] **Code quality automation** - Pylint fixes and validation
- [ ] Add coverage targets to Makefile
- [ ] Optional CI config (GitHub Actions)

## 🗺️ Phase 3: Visual and UX
- [x] **Asset infrastructure** - Complete loading and management system
- [ ] Restore Pygame engine loop with new assets
- [ ] Visual overlay hooks
- [ ] Sprite loading and animation support

## 🔧 Technical Safeguards
- Maintain `PYTHONPATH=.` in all scripts and Makefile
- Ensure every subdir with test helpers has `__init__.py`
- Treat `Makefile` as canonical test entrypoint
- Run full test suite after each refactoring change
- Use # @api tags for canonical interfaces
- Maintain 85%+ test coverage
- Pre-commit hooks for code quality (black, isort, mypy)
- **NEW**: Maintain game balance and playability testing
- **NEW**: Regular playtesting and feedback integration
- **NEW**: Tactical depth validation (positioning mechanics)
- **NEW**: Asset license compliance and safety checks
- **NEW**: Pylint 10.00/10 code quality standards
