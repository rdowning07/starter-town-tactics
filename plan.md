# Starter Town Tactics: Learning & Build Plan

## Overview
This project is a hands-on transition accelerator from Amazon L6 PMIII to PMT/SDM. It integrates systems design, AI literacy, game dev, and software engineering through iterative delivery.

## 🧠 Learning Highlights (July 2025)

### ✅ Completed
- Object-oriented Python structure (`Game`, `Unit`, `SpriteManager`, `InputState`)
- Mouse-based tile interaction and camera panning
- Modular rendering overlays
- Keyboard input controller for WASD and turn control
- Test suite built up from simple validation to behavior simulation
- Git pre-commit: `black`, `isort`, `mypy`, `pylint`
- GitHub usage (remote syncing, cleanup, and commits)
- Architecture pattern: input controller → game logic → visual layers

### 🧠 AI Integration (In Progress)
- Planning MCP/agent integration for enemy decision-making
- Will use simple enemy AI in Week 4 as scaffold

## 🗺️ August 2025 – What’s Next

| Goal | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 🎯 FSM Design | Turn-based phase controller (Player vs Enemy) |
| 🤖 AI Agents | Basic pathfinding + decision flow for enemy movement |
| 🎨 Visual Polish | Add animation stubs and queued UI layers |
| 🧪 GitHub Actions | Auto-test runner and pre-merge checks |
| 📚 Documentation | Showcase README, resume-quality artifact, career narrative |

## 📌 Strategic Relevance
This codebase demonstrates:
- Design-for-extensibility and code quality
- Developer empathy through testing and modularity
- Technical ownership across architecture and tooling
- Real-world application of AI, input mapping, and visual pipelines
