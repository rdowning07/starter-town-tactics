# Starter Town Tactics - Development Plan

## 🎯 Project Overview
A tactical turn-based strategy game built with Python and Pygame, featuring modular architecture, comprehensive testing, and professional asset management with cinematic camera control.

## ✅ COMPLETED PHASES

### Phase 1: Core Systems & Turn Controller
- ✅ Unit AP, HP, death, and team tracking
- ✅ TacticalStateMachine implemented
- ✅ TurnController and SimRunner with AI loop
- ✅ Input systems (keyboard, gamepad, CLI)

### Phase 2: Scenario & YAML Loading
- ✅ ScenarioLoader with YAML-driven units and maps
- ✅ MapLoader with `.map` format
- ✅ SimRunner integration with scenarios
- ✅ GameState and UnitManager orchestration

### Phase 3: Terrain System + Overlays
- ✅ OverlayState toggle system
- ✅ Threat zones, movement range, terrain cost overlays
- ✅ CLI + SimRunner overlay viewer
- ✅ Refactored grid, tile, and debug drawing

### Phase 4: Visual Rendering ✅ (COMPLETED)
- ✅ Created `renderer.py` to draw grid and terrain
- ✅ Show unit sprites and cursor overlays
- ✅ Add animation state to units
- ✅ Visual AP, HP, and action indicators
- ✅ Integrate overlays into pygame display
- ✅ Build visual debugger (step-by-step)
- ✅ Refactor grid.py for render integration
- ✅ Build tile and unit sprite loading system
- ✅ Render `Tile` types via SpriteManager
- ✅ Render overlays from OverlayState
- ✅ Update Unit to track animation state
- ✅ Create unit rendering pipeline (idle/move/etc.)
- ✅ Create CLI and Visual animation testers
- ✅ Integrate sprite sheet loading system
- ✅ Add metadata-driven animation configuration
- ✅ Implement pygame initialization utilities
- ✅ Create comprehensive testing framework
- ✅ Integrate sprite sheet `future1.png` (6 new units)
- ✅ Create automated sprite sheet processing
- ✅ Standardize animation folder structure
- ✅ Add metadata validation and testing
- ✅ Create asset scanning and validation tools
- ✅ Implement FXManager for visual effects (screen shake, flash, particles)
- ✅ Add SoundManager for audio playback with animation triggers
- ✅ Create frame-aware FX and sound triggering system
- ✅ Integrate FX and sound with animation metadata
- ✅ Add cinematic cutscene demo with AI-triggered animations

### 📊 Current Asset Status
- ✅ **6 Fully Integrated Units:** Knight, Ranger, Mage, Paladin, Shadow, Berserker
- ✅ **Complete Animation System:** idle, walk, attack, hurt, die, stun animations
- ✅ **Metadata-Driven Configuration:** JSON-based animation settings with FX/sound triggers
- ✅ **Testing Tools:** CLI and Visual animation testers working
- ✅ **FX & Sound Integration:** Screen shake, flash, particles, and audio triggers
- ⚠️ **34 Units Need Metadata:** Existing units need animation metadata
- ⚠️ **6 Units Missing Walk Animations:** void_revenant, archer, goblin, crystal_archon, ai, phoenix_binder

## 🚧 PHASE 5: GAMEPLAY POLISH (CURRENT)

### 🎯 Goals
- ✅ Camera movement and cinematic panning
- ✅ Scripted scenario actions and branching
- ✅ YAML-driven camera integration
- [ ] Advanced animation branching and combos
- [ ] Enhanced AI behaviors and strategies
- [ ] Performance optimization and polish

### 🎬 Camera System Integration ✅ (COMPLETED)
- ✅ Created `CameraController.py` with smooth movement and cinematic panning
- ✅ Integrated camera system with scenario loader
- ✅ Added YAML camera action support (pan, targets, speed, delay)
- ✅ Updated all 6 scenario files with camera actions
- ✅ Added comprehensive camera system tests
- ✅ Integrated camera with main game loop
- ✅ Added AI actions and general actions processing
- ✅ Enhanced scenario loader with camera parameter support

### 🎭 Scenario System Enhancements ✅ (COMPLETED)
- ✅ Updated scenario YAML structure with camera, AI, and actions sections
- ✅ Enhanced unit definitions with sprites, coordinates, and animations
- ✅ Added AI behavior processing (attack, move actions)
- ✅ Added general action processing (prepare_for_battle)
- ✅ Updated all scenario files: demo_cutscene, demo_battle, skirmish_4v4, boss_fake_death, survive_the_horde, scripted_loss_intro
- ✅ Added comprehensive testing for new scenario features
- ✅ Fixed integration with GameState and UnitManager APIs

### 🎨 Asset Standardization (Optional)
- [ ] Run `make setup-animations` to standardize all 40 units
- [ ] Add metadata for 34 units missing animation configuration
- [ ] Create walk animations for 6 units missing them
- [ ] Validate all units with `make test-animations`
- [ ] Update unit mapping to include all standardized units

### 🚀 Phase 5 Preparation
- [ ] Integrate sound effects with animation triggers
- [ ] Add visual effects (particles, screen shake, etc.)
- [ ] Implement team-based sprite variations
- [ ] Add animation state machines for complex sequences
- [ ] Create animation editor for custom sequences
