# Starter Town Tactics: Learning & Build Plan

## Overview
This project is part of a structured journey to transition from an L6 Program Manager III at Amazon to a Principal PMT or SDM role. It serves as both a hands-on learning platform and a way to demonstrate proficiency in software development, testing, AI integration, and product thinking.

## 🧠 Learning Highlights (July 2025)

### Technical Accomplishments
- ✅ Implemented a working , , and  system using object-oriented Python.
- ✅ Built movement logic with edge cases for unit interaction on the grid.
- ✅ Used **Pytest** to test unit movement, invalid actions, terrain limitations.
- ✅ Applied pre-commit hooks: , 

                 _                 _
                (_) ___  ___  _ __| |_
                | |/ _/ / _ \/ '__  _/
                | |\__ \/\_\/| |  | |_
                |_|\___/\___/\_/   \_/

      isort your imports, so you don't have to.

                    VERSION 6.0.1


Nothing to do: no files or paths have been passed in!

Try one of the following:

    `isort .` - sort all Python files, starting from the current directory, recursively.
    `isort . --interactive` - Do the same, but ask before making any changes.
    `isort . --check --diff` - Check to see if imports are correctly sorted within this project.
    `isort --help` - In-depth information about isort's available command-line options.

Visit https://pycqa.github.io/isort/ for complete information about how to use isort., No files to lint: exiting., and .
- ✅ Managed GitHub project setup, , and file structure cleanup.
- ✅ Used virtual environment (venv) effectively in VS Code.

### AI-Assisted Development
- 🧠 Used ChatGPT to:
  - Generate class templates and explain Python OOP
  - Scaffold and debug test suites
  - Walk through VS Code Git workflows
  - Auto-generate content like this very file
