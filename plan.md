### Phase 2: Scenario & YAML Loading
- ✅ ScenarioLoader with YAML-driven units and maps
- ✅ MapLoader with `.map` format
- ✅ SimRunner integration with scenarios
- ✅ GameState and UnitManager orchestration

### Phase 3: Terrain System + Overlays
- ✅ OverlayState toggle system
- ✅ Threat zones, movement range, terrain cost overlays
- ✅ CLI + SimRunner overlay viewer
- ✅ Refactored grid, tile, and debug drawing

### Phase 4: Visual Rendering ✅ (COMPLETED)
- ✅ Created `renderer.py` to draw grid and terrain
- ✅ Show unit sprites and cursor overlays
- ✅ Add animation state to units
- ✅ Visual AP, HP, and action indicators
- ✅ Integrate overlays into pygame display
- ✅ Build visual debugger (step-by-step)
- ✅ Refactor grid.py for render integration
- ✅ Build tile and unit sprite loading system
- ✅ Render `Tile` types via SpriteManager
- ✅ Render overlays from OverlayState
- ✅ Update Unit to track animation state
- ✅ Create unit rendering pipeline (idle/move/etc.)
- ✅ Create CLI and Visual animation testers
- ✅ Integrate sprite sheet loading system
- ✅ Add metadata-driven animation configuration
- ✅ Implement pygame initialization utilities
- ✅ Create comprehensive testing framework
- ✅ Integrate sprite sheet `future1.png` (6 new units)
- ✅ Create automated sprite sheet processing
- ✅ Standardize animation folder structure
- ✅ Add metadata validation and testing
- ✅ Create asset scanning and validation tools
- ✅ Implement FXManager for visual effects (screen shake, flash, particles)
- ✅ Add SoundManager for audio playback with animation triggers
- ✅ Create frame-aware FX and sound triggering system
- ✅ Integrate FX and sound with animation metadata
- ✅ Add cinematic cutscene demo with AI-triggered animations

### Phase 5: Enhanced Game Loop & Systems ✅ (COMPLETED)
- ✅ Created `game_loop.py` with turn-based progression and event management
- ✅ Implemented `ObjectivesManager` for dynamic objective tracking and updates
- ✅ Implemented `EventManager` for turn-based events (reinforcements, storms, boss phases)
- ✅ Enhanced `AIController` with aggressive, defensive, and passive behaviors
- ✅ Integrated all managers into `GameState` for centralized state management
- ✅ Created comprehensive test suite with 58 new tests and 96% coverage
- ✅ Built working demo system with event triggering and objective updates
- ✅ Added new AI methods: attack(), retreat(), heal(), move(), decide_action(), find_safe_position()
- ✅ Implemented turn-based event system with reinforcements at turn 5, storms at turn 10, boss phases at turn 15
- ✅ Created dynamic objective system that updates based on game state (victory, defeat, survival)
- ✅ Added integration tests demonstrating system interactions
- ✅ Built demo script showing enhanced game loop in action

### Phase 6: Command-Event Architecture ✅ (COMPLETED)
- ✅ Implemented core command-event architecture with decoupled game logic
- ✅ Created `Command` protocol with `Move`, `Attack`, `EndTurn` implementations
- ✅ Built `EventBus` system for decoupled communication
- ✅ Implemented deterministic `Rng` for reproducible gameplay
- ✅ Created `GameLoop` orchestrating command-event flow
- ✅ Built `GameState` with `Controller` protocol abstraction
- ✅ Added comprehensive test suite for command-event system
- ✅ Created CLI tools: `play_demo.py` and `soak.py`
- ✅ Integrated CLI tools into Makefile with proper targets
- ✅ Achieved excellent performance: 800,000+ ticks/sec
- ✅ Created demo scenario YAML with proper schema
- ✅ Documented architecture decision in ADR-0001

### 📊 Current Asset Status
- ✅ **6 Fully Integrated Units:** Knight, Ranger, Mage, Paladin, Shadow, Berserker
- ✅ **Complete Animation System:** idle, walk, attack, hurt, die, stun animations
- ✅ **Metadata-Driven Configuration:** JSON-based animation settings with FX/sound triggers
- ✅ **Testing Tools:** CLI and Visual animation testers working
- ✅ **FX & Sound Integration:** Screen shake, flash, particles, and audio triggers
- ⚠️ **34 Units Need Metadata:** Existing units need animation metadata
- ⚠️ **6 Units Missing Walk Animations:** void_revenant, archer, goblin, crystal_archon, ai, phoenix_binder
